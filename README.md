## Describe your project
My project is a 16x16 simplified Minecraft block. While coding the art, I used different methods, some having parameters, to make the process of completeing this project easier. For example, I have the createBlock(); method, and that helped with creating the 14x14 brown square that was used in the final product. 

BackgroundArtist is a separate class that just creates a white background for the Minecraft block. 

There are 3 major ones found in the AsphaltArtist class: startBlock(); createBlock(); createGrass();

startBlock(); - Moves the painter to the correct position to get started on the art.
createBlock(); - Creates the 14x14 brown square.
createGrass(); - Creates the grass patch on top of the brown square. 

## What part of your project are you most proud of?
I'm proud of how I was able to fix the problems within my code. Sometimes the code would break, and I would have to create something that simplifies the amount of lines, or to just copy and paste altogether. In the end, it all works out because it displays what I wanted. 

## Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.
If I were to start the project tommorow, I would think of how to complete this project in an efficient way. Lookin at my code, it follows the criteria but it doesn't look good; using more loops and algorithms would help out. Also, I should put more time into adding more details towards the final product of the art.
